## 📌 Overview

**AI Business Operations Copilot** is a full-stack AI application designed to help businesses manage operations, analyze sales, understand customers, generate reports, draft emails, and ask questions from uploaded business documents.

The system uses a **LangGraph Supervisor Agent** to route user requests to specialized AI agents such as:

- CRM Agent
- Sales Agent
- Report Agent
- Email Agent
- Knowledge Agent
- RAG Document Agent

This makes the application more than a chatbot — it behaves like an AI-powered business operations assistant.
